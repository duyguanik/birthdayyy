        <p><strong>My Love,</strong></p>
        <p>Little did I know that 24 years ago today, the love of my life, the light in my days, and the peace in my storms would be born. I love you more than words can express, and I will love you for the rest of my life...</p>
        <p>Today is the most special day for me because you are the most important person in my life. It feels like a miracle that you were born in India and I was born in T√ºrkiye, yet somehow, against all odds, we found each other in Germany. Don‚Äôt you think we were meant to be?</p>
        <p>My love, you are the first person with whom I‚Äôve ever dreamed of building a future. On nights when I can‚Äôt sleep, I look at our pictures and videos, imagining the life we will create together...</p>
        <p>You deserve nothing but the best, and I promise that I will be there for your next birthday. I know this is the first and last birthday we‚Äôll have to spend apart and after this, we will be together forever.</p>
        <p>I wish you a life filled with happiness, success, peace, health, and most importantly‚Ä¶ ME! Happy birthday, my love. I am so incredibly grateful that you were born...</p>
        <p><strong>I love you more than words can say, I love you endlessly, I love you in every universe. ‚ù§Ô∏è</strong></p>
